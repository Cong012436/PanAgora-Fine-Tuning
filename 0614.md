## Fine-Tuning Llama-2-7b for Analyzing Financial News Titles

**Cong Liu**

### Purpose

Fine tune Llama-2-7b model to be able to analyze the related company and sentiment from a financial news title. This may be helpful if used to automatically monitor news flow in the market.

### Dataset

My training data are around 3000 news title from Bloomberg, which are all filtered to be "highly" related to Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft, i.e. 3 companies with highest market value among US stock market. Some of the titles have obvious sentiment toward those companies, while others may be ambiguous or no related at all. Therefore, the first task of LLM would be identifying which company (or companies, or none of them) are related to the news. Then the second task would be presenting the sentiment of the title and explain the reason and logic behind it.

After gathering all the news title, I use GPT-4o to generate "benchmark" answers for training purpose.

Sample of the training dataset is attached below:

| Titles                                                       | Output                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Musk Threatens Apple Partnership, Musk  Threatens Ban (Video) | The news pertains to Apple. The sentiment appears to be negative. The  cause of the sentiment is the threat made by Elon Musk towards Apple, which  could indicate potential conflicts or disagreements between Musk's company  and Apple, leading to uncertainty or potential disruption in their  partnership. |
| Nvidia’s 2H Growth  Potential Bolstered by TSMC's May Data: React | This news pertains to Nvidia.           **Analysis:**     - **Sentiment: Positive**     - **Cause of Sentiment:** The sentiment is positive as it highlights  Nvidia's growth potential in the second half of the year, supported by data  from TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company). TSMC is a critical  supplier for Nvidia, particularly for its graphics processing units (GPUs)  and other semiconductor needs. Positive data from TSMC likely indicates  strong production capacity and supply chain stability, which are crucial for  Nvidia to meet demand and continue growing. This type of news typically  signals good business prospects and reinforces confidence in the company’s  near-term future. |
| Apple Unveils ‘AI for the Rest of Us’ in  Bid to Retake Spotlight | This news pertains to Apple.          Brief Analysis:      The sentiment in this news appears to be positive. Apple's unveiling of an  AI initiative aimed at making artificial intelligence more accessible  ("AI for the Rest of Us") suggests a proactive and inclusive  approach. This move indicates Apple's effort to innovate and remain  competitive in the technology landscape, particularly in AI. The positive  sentiment stems from Apple's focus on user-friendly AI solutions, which can  help retake the spotlight in a competitive market by appealing to a broad  audience. |
| Microsoft Rated New  Buy at New Street Research; PT $570     | This news pertains to Microsoft. The  sentiment appears to be positive. This assessment is based on the fact that  New Street Research has initiated coverage of Microsoft with a  "Buy" rating, indicating confidence in the company's future  performance. Additionally, the price target (PT) of $570 suggests an  expectation of significant upside potential from Microsoft's current stock  price. Generally, such ratings and optimistic price targets reflect positive  sentiment towards the company's prospects. |
| Musk Cites  "Unacceptable Security Violation" for Possible Ban | This news does not directly pertain to Apple,  Nvidia, or Microsoft. It seems to be related to Elon Musk, potentially in his  role at Twitter or another venture.           However, if there were more context connecting this issue to security  measures impacting any of the three companies, we could discuss the  implications. For example, if Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft were involved in  any security violations that prompted Musk to comment, the sentiment could  lean negative, focusing on concerns over security and trust. Without that  context, the news is not directly relevant to Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft. |

### Training Process

**Machine**: Some article said that it is possible to train Llama-2 only using the free version of Google Colab. However,  [their code](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/fine-tuning-llama-2) is actually not able to perform. There are 2 solutions for this problem:

1. Change the version of certain packages: 

   ```python
   !pip install -q peft==0.5.0 bitsandbytes==0.40.2 transformers==4.34.0 trl==0.7.2 
   ```

   After specifying those versions, the codes can be performed.

2. Change certain hyper-parameters:

   ```python
   per_device_train_batch_size=8 -> per_device_train_batch_size=1
   max_seq_length=None -> max_seq_length=256
   ```

These two solutions can each enable the code to perform with free Colab resources, with low speed. To speed up the training process, I rent an A100 GPU online, together with my own dataset, the code can be performed easily with all packages updated and not changing hyper-parameters.

**Instruction**: The input to Llama-2-7b model is in the format of: 

```python
f"<s>[INST] Identify if this news pertains to Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft. If it does, provide a brief analysis stating whether the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative, focusing on the cause of the sentiment. The news title is: {Titles} [/INST] {Output} </s>"
```

where "Titles" and "Output" can be found in the dataset (with examples above).

**Base model**: NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

**Key hyper-parameters:**

- per_device_train_batch_size = 8
- optim = "paged_adamw_32bit"
- learning_rate = 2e-4
- group_by_length = True
- lr_scheduler_type = "constant"

### Fine-Tuning Outcome

pic.1 Training Loss ~ Step

After 375 steps of training, the loss is around 0.7.

#### Sample Test News Title

In this section, I will show the performance of original (base) model, the fine-tuned model and gpt-4o.

**News title 1: [ALTMAN SEEKS TO RAISE BILLIONS FOR NETWORK OF AI CHIP FACTORIES](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/altman-seeks-to-raise-billions-for-network-of-ai-chip-factories)**

**My own analyze for the title:** Nvidia, Positive. This title did not specify which company is related, only with the clue of "AI CHIP FACTORIES". And it shows that the demand for AI chips is higher than supply, which indicates positive prospect for Nvidia.

From the generated text below, we can see that both Llama-2 model successfully identified that this news is related to Nvidia, while gpt-4o failed. However, the fine-tuned version of Llama-2 model successfully identified that this news title is positive for Nvidia.

Base model: 

```
Based on the news title, this pertains to Nvidia. Here's a brief analysis of the sentiment:

Sentiment: Neutral

Cause of sentiment: The news article is about Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, seeking to raise billions of dollars to build a network of AI chip factories. This indicates that Nvidia is investing heavily in the development and production of AI chips, which could lead to increased competition in the market and potentially impact the profitability of other companies, including Apple and Microsoft. However, the neutral sentiment is also due to the fact that the article does not provide any specific details on the amount of funding being raised or the timeline for the project, which could impact the overall sentiment.
```

After fine-tuning:

```
This news pertains to Nvidia.

Analysis: The sentiment is positive. The initiative to raise billions for a network of AI chip factories indicates Nvidia's commitment to expanding its production capabilities and technological advancements in the AI sector. This could potentially lead to increased market share, improved product offerings, and enhanced competitiveness in the AI chip market.

Cause of Sentiment: The positive sentiment is driven by Nvidia's proactive steps to enhance its manufacturing capabilities, which is likely to benefit the company's future growth and competitiveness in the AI chip market.
```

GPT-4o:

```
This news does not pertain to Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft directly. It concerns Sam Altman, who is known for his work in AI and as a CEO of OpenAI.
However, if Nvidia, Apple, or Microsoft were mentioned as collaborators or impacted by this development, it could be re-evaluated. Based on the given information, no direct connection to these companies is specified.
```



**News title 2: EPIC CEO SAYS TO CONTEST APPLE'S COMPLIANCE PLAN IN COURT**

**My own analyze:** Apple, neutral to negative. The outcome of the "contest" is unknown, so the sentiment is actually uncertain. However, bad outcome (for Apple) can possibly happen.

The original Llama-2 model failed to identify that this news is related to Apple, while the fine-tuned version made it. However, the fine-tuned version is less accurate about the sentiment within the news title.

Base model: 

```
Based on the news title, the company being referred to is Epic Games, not Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft. Here's a brief analysis of the sentiment:

Company: Epic Games
Sentiment: Negative

Reason: The news title suggests that Epic Games is taking legal action against Apple in court, which implies a negative sentiment towards the company. The CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, is quoted as saying that Apple's compliance plan is unacceptable and that the company will contest it in court. This could be due to a disagreement over Apple's policies or practices, which has led to a negative sentiment towards the company.
```

After fine-tuning:

```
This news pertains to Apple. The sentiment appears to be negative for Apple as it suggests potential legal challenges and regulatory scrutiny. The cause of the negative sentiment is the impending legal contest over Apple's compliance plan, which could lead to delays, financial burdens, and potential reputational damage for the company. 

The context suggests that the issue is not related to any specific product or service but rather a broader regulatory issue that could impact Apple's operations and public image. The sentiment is therefore negative due to the potential legal and regulatory challenges that could arise from this situation.
```

GPT-4o:

```
This news pertains to Apple. The sentiment here can be interpreted as neutral to negative, depending on the viewpoint. From Apple's perspective, this represents a legal challenge, suggesting a negative impact as Epic Games is opposing Apple's compliance plan in court. The cause of the sentiment lies in the ongoing legal disputes between Epic Games and Apple, primarily centered around app store policies and revenue sharing practices. This continuing conflict suggests potential legal and financial implications for Apple.
```



**News title 3: Apple Offers Discount for iPhone 15, Some Products in China**

**My own analyze:** Apple, neutral. Offering discount can boost sales number, but decreasing marginal profit at the same time. This can also be a signal of Apple's product become less popular in China, while not certain in the title.

What makes this observation interesting is that the fine-tuned version of Llama-2 can generate almost 80% similar analyze comparing to GPT-4o! It means that the fine-tuning is quite successful and has the prospect to replace the use of GPT to some extent.

Base model: 

```
The news pertains to Apple, so here is a brief analysis of the sentiment:

Sentiment: Neutral

Cause of sentiment: Apple's decision to offer discounts on some products in China is likely a strategic move to boost sales in the country, where the company has faced declining demand in recent years. The discounts may also be a response to the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, which have had a negative impact on Apple's business in the region. While the discounts may be seen as a positive move for customers, they may also be a sign of a challenging market for Apple in China.
```

After fine-tuning:

```
This news pertains to Apple. The sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. The discount offered for the iPhone 15 and other products in China could be seen as a strategic move to boost sales in a key market, which could be beneficial for Apple's business. However, without further details on the impact of the discount on Apple's profitability or market share, the overall sentiment remains neutral to slightly positive.
```

GPT-4o:

```
This news pertains to Apple. The sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. Offering a discount on the iPhone 15 and other products in China can be seen as a strategic move to boost sales and increase market penetration in a highly competitive market. The sentiment is positive if it leads to increased customer acquisition and sales volume; however, it could also reflect an attempt to address lagging sales, which would be a more neutral sentiment
```

### Attempts to Adjust Hyperparameters

There is weird "jumps" in the training loss curve every 50 steps. I have tried to adjust learning rate,  lr_scheduler_type but neither works.

![image-20240614150110519](C:\Users\41703\Downloads\lr_schedler)

However, after I changed `group_by_length` from `True` to `False`, the loss curve became smoother. However, the loss is higher than the original one, at around 0.8 after 200 steps (original one is 0.71).
